## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why can't I use hotkeys for Grab, Rotate, Scale on Home Builder Assets?

Since Home Builder Assets are parametric you can not move rotate or scale mesh objects using the `G` `R` `S` `X` and `Tab` hotkey commands. You can change the location, rotation, and size of home builder assets by accessing the right click prompts interface. If you still want to use the Hot Key Commands you can select the base point of the asset in the outliner and use any hot keys with the base point selected.

### How do I switch between Metric, Imperial, Inch, Feet, Meter, and Millimeter Units?

Blender supports a wide variety of unit types. You can change this in the Blender Scene Properties Interface. Since this is a common setting that needs to be changed Home Builder has these properties available in the `Home Builder > Change Units` Interface. This is available in the top header.

### When I drag a Home Builder asset From the default Asset Browser I just get a cube?

The default Asset Browser in Blender doesn't support custom drag and drop events, so you must use the Home Builder Asset Browser available in the 3D Viewport Sidebar.

### I am getting an error. What should I do? 

First, make sure you are running the latest version of the software. In the About Interface you can click the `Check for Updates` button. If an update is available a dialog will appear that will automatically download and install the update.

If you are still running into an error then report the issues on the [:fontawesome-brands-discord:{ .discord } Discord Channel](https://creativedesigner3d.com/2021/09/08/discord-channel/).
