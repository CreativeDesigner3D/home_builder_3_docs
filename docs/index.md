Home Builder Is a free add-on for Blender that simplifies the process of designing interior architectural spaces with a strong focus on kitchens, baths, and closets for homes. 

Home Builder is currently in beta and is actively being developed. The source code is hosted on :fontawesome-brands-github:{ .github } Github and can be found [here](https://github.com/CreativeDesigner3D/home_builder). Feel free to learn from it, modify it, distribute custom versions, and develop new libraries.

## Features

* Draw Wall Command - The draw wall command allows you to quickly draw rooms. You can enter in exact dimensions while drawing walls, and hold `Ctrl` to change the angle.

* Extensive Library of Products - Home Builder comes with a wide variety of Cabinets, Appliances, Doors, Windows, and Bathroom Fixtures.

* Drag and Drop - All assets can be dragged and dropped from the browser into the 3D Viewport.

* Intuitive Placement of Assets - Each asset type has it's own logic on how it should be placed in the scene. Doors and Windows snap to walls and automatically cut holes in walls. Cabinets snap to walls and snap together in a logical way.

* Material Pointers - All of the library data is setup to work with material pointers. This allows you to quickly swap out different materials in your scene.

* Right Click Prompts Interface - Every asset has a custom prompts interface that can be access by right clicking with the asset selected. The prompts interface is organized in a way to make all the options easy to find. These options allow you to change out different components for doors and windows. Cabinet Prompts allow you to change construction and finishing options.

* Library Settings - A custom interface is available for each library allowing you to change default settings about the library. The Cabinet Library gives you a quick way to switch out different components for door styles and hardware.

* Customizable Library - Every aspect of Home Builder is customizable. You can easily save your own decorations and materials to the library. Since the add-on is open source you can even customize the construction of the cabinet data, and design new libraries based on your needs.

* 2D Drawing Commands - Plan and Elevation drawings can be created to quickly create technical documentation that you can provide to a contractor or installer.

* Manufacturing Output - All of the cabinet data can be exported for manufacturing. This is not available in the sample library data, because it needs to be configured based on your manufacturing and construction process.
