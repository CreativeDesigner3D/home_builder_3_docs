This includes:</p> <ul> <li>Parametric Library Assets - Parametric assets can be any models that can change size in a logical way, and provide users a number of custom properties to change various options for your assets. </li> <li>Custom Prompt Interface - When right clicking with a product asset selected, users can access the prompts page which can include any information you want to provied to the user.</li> <li>Custom Asset Commands - When right clicking with a product asset selected, users can access commands that allow them to interact with products with custom commands.</li> <li>Custom Drop Functionality - When dragging and dropping a product from the library you can define how these assets snap together giving users an easy way of placing products from the library.</li> <li>Custom Library Settings UI - You might have custom options that change information about the product assets. This UI is shown to the right of the library category.</li> <li>Reports that Extract Data Rrom Your Parametric Assets - One of the big reasons of devloping a product library is to be able to extract specific information from your products. This can include reports that display pricing information for your products, cutlists, or product detail reports.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"04_library_development/#the-product-library-structure","title":"The Product Library Structure","text":"<p>Product libraries are registered in a python package.

While it is common this will be in the PRODUCTS library you can register libraries for {'PRODUCTS' , 'STARTERS' , 'INSERTS' , 'PARTS' , 'BUILD_LIBRARY' , 'DECORATIONS' , 'MATERIALS'}</li> <li>library_path - This is the path where Home Builder should look for the .blend file where the assets are stored. These are the assets that are displayed in the Home Builder Asset Browser.</li> <li>library_menu_id - This is the class name of the Blender Menu that is displayed to the right of the library category. You can add any library settings into this interface.</li> <li>library_activate_id - This is the bl_id of the operator that is used when clicking on an asset in the asset browser. This doesn't need to be implement all of Home Builders libraries just use the drop_id, but this was added just in case a library needed an event to trigger when an asset is simply clicked.</li> <li>library_drop_id - This is the bl_id of the operator that is used when dragging an asset in the asset browser. This is typically a modal operator that handles building or retriving the asset and determining how the asset should be placed in the scene. These operators can be difficult to implement since there is so much flexibility. It is recommended to review Blenders Documentation and exsisting Home Builder operators to see how these work.</li> </ul> <p>Warning</p> <p>I am still working on the rest of the documentation for this page. This is a big topic. The information here doesn't even scratch the surface on what is possible. I will create tutorials and more information on how to develop libraries for Home Builder soon.
